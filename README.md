Create a Restful API which will be used by the simple blog web application.
The application should have one user role - PUBLISHER.
REST resources to implement:
   1. Resource to authenticate a particular user. Users may be hardcoded.
   2. Create, update, delete own blog posts.
   3. Get the list of all blog posts. Filter option to get only own posts should be present.
   4. Get a particular blog post by id.
The publisher should be able to update or remove only own posts. All REST resources must be secure except the authentication one.
Short readme with instructions how to build and run application should be present.
API documentation or curl requests are appreciated.
Required technologies: Java 8 and any desired DB's and frameworks.
